## [](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/subscan-funding-proposal-for-subscan-explorer-operations-on-moonbeam-moonriver-and-moonbase-networks-2025/2345#p-7670-abstract-1)**Abstract**

Subscan Explorer provides critical infrastructure for the Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase networks, delivering:

-   **Accurate on-chain data indexing**  for transactions, staking, governance, EVM, and more
    
-   **Timely technical response**  to network upgrades and runtime updates
    
-   **Continuous network monitoring**, performance tracking, and anomaly alerts
    
-   **Free community APIs**  powering dashboards, bots, tools, and analytics
    

We are pleased to submit this proposal to the Moonbeam and Moonriver communities, requesting treasury support for Subscan’s  **full-year operations in 2025**  across all three networks.

Over the past year, we delivered major improvements including  **Balances.Freezes support**  and the upcoming  **on-chain event/extrinsic subscription module**. Subscan also continues providing  **free API services**  to all developers and community users, enabling greater ecosystem innovation.

This proposal ensures reliable, uninterrupted service throughout 2025 and establishes a foundation for  **quarterly reporting and higher cost transparency starting in 2026**.

The Moonbeam ecosystem requires highly available and precise data infrastructure to support developers, validators, builders, and users. Subscan plays a foundational role by offering:

-   **EVM functionality expansion**: NFT, contract verification, cross-chain support
    
-   **Stable governance & staking metrics**  for transparent decision-making
    
-   **Unified EVM + Substrate experience**, simplifying usage and development
    
-   **Free public APIs**, essential for many community and developer tools
    

Supporting Subscan directly supports the ecosystem’s reliability, transparency, and long-term developer friendliness.

Our public API remains open and free for developers, powering a wide range of ecosystem applications.

### [](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/subscan-funding-proposal-for-subscan-explorer-operations-on-moonbeam-moonriver-and-moonbase-networks-2025/2345#p-7670-unified-resource-based-billing-model-10)**Unified, Resource-Based Billing Model**

Subscan now uses a unified billing model based on  **actual data usage**, replacing the old fixed-per-chain structure.  
Networks with higher resource consumption contribute proportionally more, making the model fair and reflective of real operational load.

During 2022–2023, part of Moonbeam’s cost was subsidized by internal and grant-funded support, meaning historical bills did not fully represent true operational expenses. The new model corrects this structural gap.

2024 pricing is the first year that accurately reflects Subscan’s true cost as a  **production-grade SaaS platform**.  
Thus, 2025 estimates are based on a realistic and stable baseline.

We continue optimizing infrastructure, and improvements in 2024–2025 already show reduced overhead. These optimizations are expected to further reduce costs in 2026.

Subscan’s expenses extend far beyond cloud hosting, including:

-   Continuous runtime compatibility work
    
-   Frequent Substrate & EVM feature maintenance
    
-   DevOps operations and 24/7 alerting
    
-   Maintaining consistent multi-chain UI/UX
    
-   Operating the public API gateway used across the ecosystem
    

Comparing Subscan to simple cloud hosting is not accurate — it is closer to  **Etherscan-level SaaS infrastructure**, not a basic server provider.

We acknowledge community concerns regarding possible cost increases and therefore make the following commitments:

Infrastructure optimization efforts are ongoing and already showing positive results.

This cost ceiling applies even if on-chain data continues to grow.

These will be publicly announced once the model stabilizes.  
Annual prepayment will always receive the highest discount tier.

This proposal covers Subscan operations for Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase for the entire year of 2025.  
Cost estimates follow the resource-based model and use 2024 usage trends as the baseline.

Starting in 2026, Subscan will transition to a  **quarterly treasury request model**, enabling improved transparency and detailed progress/cost reporting.  
Annual prepayments will continue to benefit from the most favorable discount tier.

Subscan’s monthly cost is based on data usage for each network.  
Given daily usage fluctuations, we rely on  **audited H1 2025 data**, calculated as:

> **Annual Cost = (H1 actual usage × 2) × 20% annual prepayment discount**

The 20% discount normally applies only to early yearly payments, but due to historical billing delays affecting this submission timing, we extend this discount to this proposal for fairness and consistency.
